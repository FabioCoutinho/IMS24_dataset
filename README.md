# OTA_OFDM_signals_indoor_nLoS_scenarios

In this repository, over-the-air~(OTA) fifth-generation~(5G) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing~(OFDM) signals are provided. 
Considering the scarcity of practical deep learning~(DL)-based works, a realistic indoor non-line-of-sight~(nLoS) scenario is explored through the adoption of an OTA wireless setup.
